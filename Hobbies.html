            <h2>Competitive Programming</h2> 
            <div class = "content">
              I enjoy programming competitively.  Writing algorithms to solve certain scenarios given to you is very fun, especially when you have to learn to implement different resources and techniques into your code.  I have been programming since I was around ten years old, and began competitively programming when I was almost fourteen.  I currently am fluent in the programming languages Python and C++.  Below is an example of a competitive programming question and their solution, created by me. <br>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <div class = "content">
              I also love to go on hikes, especially with friends.  It is a great way to spend time with people you love, as you can conversate among each other, while embracing the nature around you and enjoying the time you spend.  It is also an amazing way to exercise!  Below are different hiking trails in Canada that are very beautiful. <br>
